::: slot overview

From 2012 - 2018, we ([Christina Xu](http://christinaxu.org/) and [Gary Chou](https://garychou.com/)) have explored this question primarily through our work co-teaching "Entrepreneurial Design", a semester-long compulsory course for first-year students at [School of Visual Arts MFA in Interaction Design](http://interactionsdesign.sva.edu/) program.

The course challenges students to:

1. get comfortable with sharing their in-progress work online,
2. observe and learn to give back to communities they’re interested in, and
3. design an original crowdfunding project that can generate $1,000 by the end of the semester.

All of their work takes place in the real world, which provides students with the opportunity to learn a number of challenging lessons:

* how to negotiate and embrace real constraints
* how to design, not just for, but with communities in their work
* that they—as designers—can’t control outcomes

Along the way, they also develop their own practices and rituals around peer critique, asking for and processing feedback, lightweight prototyping, and writing as a form of reflection. The instructors serve a coaching role—we cheer the students on, guide them around or through obstacles, and synthesize lessons along the way.

After taking over a hundred students through our courses, we have determined that there are two absolutely critical abilities for independent creators today. These are:

1. **The ability to confront and navigate uncertainty** - The journey of creation requires sailing off into uncharted territory, with no preset right or wrong answers. Creators must develop practices for making decisions with incomplete data, recognizing the difference between an obstacle and a dead end, and reflecting on their progress honestly.

2. **The ability to sustain and grow relevant networks** - Networks of people who can provide a creator with advice, support, information, connections, or capital are critical infrastructure. Creators need to be just as intentional about developing this infrastructure as they are about the work itself.

Below is a repository of course materials, reflections from the instructors, student testimonials, and lessons on teaching from our courses, as well as from related iterations run at [Orbital](https://orbital.nyc).

Teaching Entrepreneurial Design has taught us a lot about the benefits and challenges of experiential instruction.

Experiential learning is an unparalleled way to get students to deal with real complexity in their process, and it is an especially useful tool for teaching about the abstract concept of “networks.” However, experiential instruction is also energy-intensive and risky for both instructors and students.

Here’s an overview of some of the major instructional challenges we have encountered:

1. **Networks are an abstract concept, and hard to teach instructionally.** It has taken us years of experimentation to come up with effective mental models, vocabulary, and exercises to help students effectively connect theory to practice.

2. **Networked fluency is something that needs to be deliberately and actively taught.** We thought that knowing how to parse, access, and leverage networks would have become more intrinsic and obvious with the rise of social networks, but our experience so far has proven otherwise.

3. **Online infrastructure is volatile.** In the last 7 years, many of the platforms we rely on for our courses have fallen into disrepair or disfavor, or are now unrecognizable after their respective pivots. Online platforms are both the tools we teach and the spaces we teach within, so we have to constantly re-evaluate.

4. **Engaging in public requires students to be courageous.** Working in public requires being open to judgment at scale, and missteps can lead to real and lasting consequences.

5. **Students are systemically unprepared to deal with ambiguity.** In our class, there is often no “right answer,” which can be incredibly unnerving for students trained in an achievement-oriented mindset.

6. **Personalized transformative experiences don’t scale.** In our model, students show up with different aspirations and skill-sets, then go on very individualized journeys. This means that what they need from us as instructors is eclectic and unpredictable, which requires a lot of emotional energy to manage.

Entrepreneurial Design has evolved over the years thanks to the contributions and insights of our previous Entrepreneurial Design co-instructors, [Christina Cacioppo](https://twitter.com/christinacaci) (co-creator, 2012) and [Leland Rechis](https://twitter.com/leland) (2014, 2015), and the guidance of our department chair [Liz Danzico](https://twitter.com/bobulate).

Special thanks to our School of Visual Arts [MFA in Interaction Design](http://interactiondesign.sva.edu) [Faculty and Staff](https://interactiondesign.sva.edu/people/faculty) colleagues. We've benefitted from the fact that the students bring with them the skills and insights developed in their other courses as well as within the experience of working together in the studio.
