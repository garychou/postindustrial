# Background

From 2014 through 2018, Christina Xu and Gary Chou have co-taught Entrepreneurial Design at School of Visual Arts [MFA in Interaction Design Program](http://interactiondesign.sva.edu/).

Drawing from their collective experience working with a range of entrepreneurs — from independent creators to venture-backed startup founders — the course takes a first principles approach to entrepreneurship education, focusing on teaching two distinct abilities:

1. **The ability to confront and navigate uncertainty:** How do you learn to sail into uncharted territory, to make decisions with incomplete data, to be open to the options that have yet to reveal themselves?

2. **The ability to sustain and grow relevant networks:** How do you cultivate the groups of people relevant to your pursuit, from which you will access support, collaborators, resources and opportunities?

These abilities are best developed through an experiential—rather than instructional—teaching approach. Blog posts, lectures and case studies will only get you so far. At some point, you need to “do” in order to learn.

However, teaching experientially can be both unpredictable and unwieldy, so over the years, their work has coalesced around developing and refining a simple, but powerful tool, the **$1K Challenge:**

> “Design, launch and complete a crowdfunding campaign that benefits a community you’ve worked with over the course of the semester.
> The campaign should raise at least $1,000 from 50 different backers.”

Over 100 students have taken the challenge, raising over $300K from thousands of backers [all out in the real world](https://youtu.be/e0Jsq6ZsARI?t=610). That said, the magic of the challenge isn’t in the amount of money raised—it’s in [the lessons learned along the way](https://postindustrialdesign.school/background#students):

> “It’s about there being no right answers. About fighting the tendency to ask for approval or permission. About getting out of your head and engaging with the world.”
—Nikki Sylianteng, 2012

## Our Mission

**There’s never been a more important time to prepare people to confront uncertainty,** yet we are under-resourced and unequipped as a society to do so at scale.

It’s not just you.

The turbulence we are feeling is a side-effect of the macro-level shifts we are undergoing as a society—in how information is distributed, in what entities hold power, in how people are organized.

We are just beginning to understand the massive implications of these shifts on society, culture, and the economy, which have the potential to unearth opportunities and dethrone incumbents, but also to create a tremendous amount of uncertainty and precarity.

It will not automatically level the playing field—and may even deepen existing inequalities—unless we put real effort towards doing so.

We believe that education has an important role to play in buffering society through this change in a more equitable manner, though an overhaul is needed: our current educational system spends most of its time preparing people to function within a hierarchy rather than teach them to explore the unknown.

Through the past seven years of teaching and working with students, artists, entrepreneurs, and activists, we have learned that there are two fundamental abilities that help creators thrive in today’s chaos:

The ability to confront and navigate uncertainty - The journey of creation requires sailing off into uncharted territory, with no preset right or wrong answers. Creators must develop practices for making decisions with incomplete data, recognizing the difference between an obstacle and a dead end, and reflecting on their progress honestly.

The ability to sustain and grow relevant networks - Networks of people who can provide a creator with advice, support, information, connections, or capital are critical infrastructure. Creators need to be just as intentional about developing this infrastructure as they are about the work itself.

While some people have more practice with or natural aptitude for these abilities, we know from experience that they can be taught effectively, and that doing so can yield profound results.

We see these abilities as fundamental to an emerging and critical form of education, which draws from pedagogies like design and entrepreneurship education.

We want to see more classrooms, training programs, and incubators teach these fundamental abilities to the people who need them the most.
