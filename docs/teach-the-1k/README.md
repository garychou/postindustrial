In May 2018, we wrapped up our 7th iteration of the Entrepreneurial Design course at SVA IXD, and the 10th iteration of this experiential learning program overall. It was our most successful version of the course thus far, and we were trying to figure out what the next step for this project should be. For months, we collected our thoughts, reflected on why this project was so compelling to us, and attempted to contextualize our efforts. We arrived at a set of hypotheses to guide us in the next phase of the project:
1. The lessons we taught through Entrepreneurial Design feel more crucial than ever for weathering today’s uncertain economic and political climate.
2. The $1K Challenge is a highly effective teaching tool in catalyzing these lessons for students.
3. Our methods and frameworks for teaching the challenge can be taught to others.

We bounced a few ideas for how to test these around—a book, a conference, etc.—and eventually decided that we should do what we tell our students to do: launch a signal out into the world and see what comes back. And so, the Teach the 1K Workshop was born.

We put out a call for applications to people who we could share our work with, specifically inviting teachers and administrators in higher education as well as people who ran or worked for community-based incubators and entrepreneurship programs. Truthfully, we didn't really know what to expect. But we were pleasantly surprised that over 50 people applied. We ended up running a shorter seminar for anyone who was interested, and a more intimate and hands-on full day workshop for a group of 16 (???) educators and activators doing a wide range of work in many different organizations and communities.

The rest of this section is an edited version of the content we shared at the workshop, originally held on February 8th, 2019, at [Orbital](http://orbital.nyc).
