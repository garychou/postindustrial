In February 2019, we convened Teach the 1K—a gathering of over 40 entrepreneurship educators and activators from a variety of backgrounds, to teach them how to teach the $1K Challenge:

> Design, launch and complete a crowdfunding campaign that benefits a community you’ve worked with over the course of the semester.  The campaign should raise at least $1,000 from 50 different backers.

We ran the workshop for a few reasons:

**First, we were at a crossroads.**

After collectively teaching for 7 years, we found ourselves at an inflection point with our work.  The $1K Challenge has been a surprising effective and resilient teaching tool for something as difficult to teach as the idea of confronting uncertainty.  We’ve come to believe in its broader importance.  While we believe it can be valuable to others, it wasn’t immediately clear to us what scaling up would look like and whether it was something we would want to pursue.  Convening a group would be a great way to explore options.

**Second, we needed a forcing function.**

While we’ve done a lot over the years, we hadn’t been forced to explain it to others.  The act of doing so would force not just a process of reflection, but a crystallization of the fundamental concepts and frameworks we use.  The act of contextualizing your own work in a manner that is easy to communicate to others is an incredibly humbling challenge in itself, and so having a specific audience to design and write for made it a doable proposition.

And so, while designing and running a workshop was a feat unto itself, perhaps a bigger win from this whole exercise was an articulation of both the need for our work and our pedagogy.

The rest of this section is an edited version of the content we shared at the workshop.
