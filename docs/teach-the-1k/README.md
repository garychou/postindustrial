When we finished teaching Entrepreneurial Design at SVA, both of us felt strongly that there was more to explore about this project, so we decided to keep collaborating. After months of collecting our thoughts, reflecting on why this project was so compelling to us, and attempting to contextualize our efforts, we arrived at a set of hypotheses that we wanted to test:
1. The lessons we taught through Entrepreneurial Design feel more crucial than ever for weathering todayâ€™s uncertain economic and political climate.
2. The $1K Challenge is a highly effective teaching tool in catalyzing these lessons for students.
3. Our methods and frameworks for teaching the challenge can be taught to others.

And so, the Teach the 1K Workshop was born.

We put out a call for applications to people who we could share our work with, specifically inviting teachers and administrators in higher education as well as people who ran or worked for community-based incubators and entrepreneurship programs. In the end, we ran a shorter seminar for anyone who was interested, and a more intimate and hands-on full day workshop for a group of 16 (???) educators and coaches.
