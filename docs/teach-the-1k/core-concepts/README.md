# Core Concepts

The design of the course is shaped by a few core concepts, some of which we have known all along, and others of which have emerged through trial and error.

## Working in Public

**The secret sauce is working in public.**  By asking the students to work on real projects in public, we incorporate real aspirations, stakes, and connections into the experience. We don’t believe in simulations or arbitrary grading systems.

Benefits:

- More holistic learning experience
- Confidence comes from muscle memory
- The rewards and benefits are real: $$, networks, skills, reputation
- You’re on the same side as your students
- Not just real financial consequences, but also other real benefits like internship and job offers.

However, this is a high cost, high reward approach.

The consequences are also real and public:

- Chaos: anything could happen—how do you prepare?
- Emotional rollercoaster
- High-touch, hard to scale effectively

This is why we decided to put this together—because it’s dangerous to try this at home without some supporting tools and materials. What follows is a series of hard-earned tools and frameworks to make this approach easier.

## Obstacle Courses

**Design an obstacle course, not a syllabus.** One thing that we have validated repeatedly is that no amount of lecturing will get across the core points of this class; some things just have to be experienced. But as the instructor, you can’t fully control or design each student’s experience—rather, you have to build an obstacle course through which an experience is likely to happen.

In designing an obstacle course, habits, challenges, and constraints are your building blocks. We have learned that it’s important to keep the objectives for the students concrete, even if our teaching goals are not.

There is no one-size-fits-all design; instead, you have to design the obstacle course based on your setting and context. There are lots of factors to consider: How do you design an obstacle course that works for the whole class when everyone starts from a different place? How do you keep people moving? How do you build trust?

Some constraints we’ve added to the $1K Challenge over the years:

* Kickstarter campaign - all or nothing

* We ask them to design with a community in mind, so that they’re forced to confront real people along the way (vs. throwing a project over the wall)

* $1k from 50 backers—clear amount that’s easy to imagine, but dissuading students from relying on a few rich family members.

## Cohorts

**Cohorts increase the surface area of learning.** Finally, we learned that teaching to a cohort is a much better experience than taking someone 1:1 through it, because it helps so much to watch other people go through the experience. To fully leverage the benefit of the cohort, we’ve learned that it helps to make the obstacle course a collaborative rather than a competitive one.

An ideal cohort is incentivized and able to support each other; has a mix of skills, resources, networks, experiences; shares something in common; and rarely comes together by accident.
