### Alternatively

[Workshop schedule goes here]
[We cut all of this because it's kind of a rehash of ED, which doesn't make sense for this web version]
[Maybe some stuff about what we were hoping to accomplish with this: the goal is to teach people how to teach a class centered around the $1K Challenge, in many different types of contexts and communities]

### What this is and isn't about

The course we designed turned out not to be about what the tech industry tends to think of as business fundamentals, like how to raise VC or build an MVP, but rather about how to get started when you have an inkling of an idea. Fundamentally, we have been exploring the question: "What enables artists, entrepreneurs, and activists to be successful in today’s networked world?"

After 10 iterations of teaching it, our current best answer to this is: the abilities to **confront and navigate uncertainty**, and to **grow and sustain relevant networks**.

### Teaching through challenges

The best way we have figured out how to teach these two skills is through something we call the $1K Challenge, which we first developed at the School of Visual Arts’ MFA in Interaction Design program. In 2018, we framed the $1K Challenge to our students at SVA as:

> "Design, launch and complete a crowdfunding campaign that benefits a community and raises at least $1,000 from 50 different backers."

### Outcomes

In response to this prompt, our students made things like [[ examples, examples, examples ]].

In the last 7 years, we have taken over 100 people through this program, who have collectively raised more than $340,000 for their ideas.

But it’s not really about the money. Instead, the money is a carrot that lures them through an obstacle course that forces them to learn real, valuable, lessons.

"This class has taught me to have **confidence** in my opinion, curiosity, and (burgeoning) expertise on design."

— Sarah Henry, ‘15

"One of the key things I learned is the** huge gulf between theory and practise**."

— Tony Chu, ‘13

"...I embrace the **possibility of failure** as a learning opportunity..."

— Leroy Tellez, ‘15

"I’ve learned that **we are worthy of other people’s support**..."

— Song Lee, ‘17
