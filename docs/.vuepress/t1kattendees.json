    "How are you currently engaged in teaching, coaching, or organizing?": "I'm currently advising food & beverage projects launching on Kickstarter.\nStarting in 2019, I'll also be working on general \"education\" initiatives with Kickstarter to help all creators launching projects on the platform.",
    "What are you hoping to get out of the 1K Workshop?": "In the next phase of my work at Kickstarter, I'd like to think about how we can continue to grow the community of Kickstarter creators. What are the methods that we haven't tried to find people who can benefit from this tool? Teach the 1K is interesting because the support provided in the classroom environment and the lower risk of the $1k project seems to remove a lot of the barriers to entry. I would love to think about how this could be scaled to other institutions (libraries, SBA, etc) through programs led by Kickstarter/Kickstarter partners.\n\nP.S. Kickstarter isn't forcing me to apply for this. I'm genuinely interested and these questions/thoughts are my own!",
