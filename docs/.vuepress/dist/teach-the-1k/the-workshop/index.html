Fundamentally, we have been exploring the question: &quot;What enables artists, entrepreneurs, and activists to be successful in today’s networked world?&quot;</p> <p>After 10 iterations of teaching it, our current best answer to this is: the abilities to <strong>confront and navigate uncertainty</strong>, and to <strong>grow and sustain relevant networks</strong>.</p> <h3 id="teaching-through-challenges"><a href="#teaching-through-challenges" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Teaching through challenges</h3> <p>The best way we have figured out how to teach these two skills is through something we call the $1K Challenge, which we first developed at the School of Visual Arts’ MFA in Interaction Design program. In 2018, we framed the $1K Challenge to our students at SVA as:</p> <blockquote><p>&quot;Design, launch and complete a crowdfunding campaign that benefits a community and raises at least $1,000 from 50 different backers.&quot;</p></blockquote> <p><img src="/assets/img/image_1.4a65ddc7.png" alt="image alt text"></p> <h3 id="outcomes"><a href="#outcomes" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Outcomes</h3> <p>In response to this prompt, our students made things like [[ examples, examples, examples ]].</p> <p>In the last 7 years, we have taken over 100 people through this program, who have collectively raised more than $340,000 for their ideas.</p> <p>But it’s not really about the money. Instead, the money is a carrot that lures them through an obstacle course that forces them to learn real, valuable, lessons.</p> <p>&quot;This class has taught me to have <strong>confidence</strong> in my opinion, curiosity, and (burgeoning) expertise on design.&quot;</p> <p>— Sarah Henry, ‘15</p> <p>&quot;One of the key things I learned is the** huge gulf between theory and practise**.&quot;</p> <p>— Tony Chu, ‘13</p> <p>&quot;...I embrace the <strong>possibility of failure</strong> as a learning opportunity...&quot;</p> <p>— Leroy Tellez, ‘15</p> <p>&quot;I’ve learned that <strong>we are worthy of other people’s support</strong>...&quot;</p> <p>— Song Lee, ‘17</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
