Instead, we did 3 weeks of abstract lectures, and then threw them right into the pool.</p> <p>From a logistical point of view, getting a student to launch something for the first time is already really challenging. As we’ll talk about later, it’s emotionally and logistically complex for both the student and the instructor.</p> <p>But as an instructor, you have an additional challenge: getting a whole cohort of students to run through the obstacle on roughly the same schedule and stay in sync with each other. It’s like herding a bunch of scared kittens! We’ve found that the best thing we can do as instructors is to make sure that everyone is at least starting on the same page, by introducing some fundamental concepts and skills.</p> <p>Training is also helpful for giving students a preview of what they will be experiencing more fully in the later phases of the challenge. Transformative learning requires repeated exposure.</p> <div class="w-100 tc mt4 mv5-ns"><img src="/images/t1k/slides_063.png" alt="At SVA, we were working within an institution that provided resources, space, and access to supportive alumni; we also had a fixed group of students and a fixed schedule. The students are generally skilled at some kind of design, but tend to be highly achievement-oriented and are juggling other commitments. Many have small or no networks in New York." class="w-100 mb1-ns ba b--black-10 pa0 w-100"> <span class="avenir f7 f6-ns tc mb4 db lh-title center caption w-100"><p><em>The context we're operating in dictates how we prepare the students.</em></p></span></div> <p>What you need to cover in Train depends on the context in which you are teaching, as well as who your students are.</p> <p>For our students, we center our Train phase around 3 fundamental skills.</p> <h2 id="being-an-explorer"><a href="#being-an-explorer" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Being an Explorer</h2> <p>To help our students move into an explorer (vs. an achiever) mindset, we structure the Train phase as a series of <strong>challenges</strong> (mini-obstacle courses designed to get students practicing fundamental skills while exploring their interests) and <strong>habits</strong> (tools and practices that help students in the journey ahead).</p> <h2 id="sending-signals"><a href="#sending-signals" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Sending Signals</h2> <p>We define a signal as a way to share intention, gather feedback, and identify allies: like a flare sent out into the world to find others curious about the same topic, or a flag planted in the sand to declare one's stance.</p> <p>Blogposts are very common signals, which make it easier for people to find you and learn what you’re about. As we've learned in our own lives, it's very helpful to be able to link to a post we've written, instead of writing people very long emails when asking for their time.</p> <div class="w-100 tc mt4 mv5-ns"><img src="/images/t1k/slides_068.png" alt="The Hello World! Challenge runs for 2 weeks and asks students to write and revise a blog post about an experience or area of expertise, publish it on Medium, and promote it on social media.

But even though having an online identity is pretty crucial for an interaction design career, we have found that many of our students really struggle with putting their work online and interacting on networks. We came up with the <em>Hello World! Challenge</em> to make sure they all had at least one published story under their belts.</p> <div class="w-100 tc mt4 mv5-ns"><img src="/images/t1k/slides_071.png" alt="The weekly blogging habit asks students to publish at least one blog post about their work in our class every week, often with prompts. Our goals are to help students surface issues and triumphs, develop a track record and online identity, practice storytelling, and hone signals." class="w-100 mb1-ns ba b--black-10 pa0 w-100"> <span class="avenir f7 f6-ns tc mb4 db lh-title center caption w-100"></span></div> <p>In fact, the Hello World Challenge is actually also the kickoff for the blogging habit we ask them to maintain throughout the semester. Asking students to blog weekly encourages them to be less precious with their thoughts and work, and to increase surface area for serendipity.</p> <h2 id="understanding-networks"><a href="#understanding-networks" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Understanding Networks</h2> <p>Helping our students build up a network is critical to their success not just in the class, but for their whole careers and lives.</p> <div class="w-100 tc mt4 mv5-ns"><img src="/images/t1k/slides_074.png" alt="A visualization of our students' networks.

White circles are parts of their networks they may not have activated yet.</em></p></span></div> <p>At SVA, we teach a lot of international students who are new to New York and often don’t have large networks in the city. We realized that this was making a huge difference in how they were able to engage with the rest of the class.</p> <div class="w-100 tc mt4 mv5-ns"><img src="/images/t1k/slides_075.png" alt="The Initial Community Offering Challenge lasts for 5 weeks. Students are asked to observe a community, design an offering (a map, repository, convening, or tutorial) for that community, share the offering with the community for feedback, and iterate upon it." class="w-100 mb1-ns ba b--black-10 pa0 w-100"> <span class="avenir f7 f6-ns tc mb4 db lh-title center caption w-100"><p><em>We're reclaiming ICOs.</em></p></span></div> <p>Through a challenge we cheekily named Initial Community Offering, we get the students to start understanding (and building) networks by spending time with a community, then iteratively designing an offering that can serve the community’s needs. The ICO challenge familiarizes students with how networks/communities work, how to observe them, and how to give back to them—essential skills if they’re really going to design something with the community, rather than making a solution based on untested assumptions.</p> <div class="w-100 tc mt4 mv5-ns"><img src="/images/t1k/slides_076.png" alt="We believe in starting with people, then figuring out a value proposition, and finally coming up with ideas to solve this specific problem—rather than the other way around.

It’s counterintuitive to start with people, but doing so reframes the exercise of design as one of deriving problems, not inventing them. This also allows us to dismantle the damaging and limiting idea of the lone wolf creative genius, and introduce in its place the concept of being a midwife of an idea birthed by the community.</p> <div class="w-100 tc mt4 mv5-ns"><img src="/images/t1k/slides_080.png" alt="Screenshots of Initial Community Offerings from Kate Styer on restorative justice, and Addi Hou on parental concerns around technology" class="w-100 mb1-ns ba b--black-10 pa0 w-100"><img src="/images/t1k/slides_081.png" alt="Screenshots of Initial Community Offerings from Kate Styer on restorative justice, and Addi Hou on parental concerns around technology" class="w-100 mb1-ns ba b--black-10 pa0 w-100"> <span class="avenir f7 f6-ns tc mb4 db lh-title center caption w-100"><p><em><strong>Top:</strong> an Initial Community Offering from <a href="https://www.katestyer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Styer<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> to the restorative justice community. <strong>Bottom:</strong> <a href="http://www.addihou.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addi Hou<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>'s ICO on parental concerns around technology</em></p></span></div> <p>By the time our students are done with the training phase, they have gone through one of the core iterative loops of our class:</p> <ol><li><strong>make something</strong> that serves as a signal</li> <li><strong>have a conversation</strong>, and</li> <li><strong>share back</strong> what they’ve learned as a new signal.</li></ol> <div></div></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
