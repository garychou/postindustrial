Instead, we did 3 weeks of abstract lectures, and then threw them right into the pool.</p> <p>From a logistical point of view, getting a student to launch something for the first time is already really challenging. As we’ll talk about later, it’s emotionally and logistically complex for both the student and the instructor.</p> <p>But as an instructor, you have an additional challenge: getting a whole cohort of students to run through the obstacle on roughly the same schedule and stay in sync with each other. It’s like herding a bunch of scared kittens! We’ve found that the best thing we can do as instructors is to make sure that everyone is at least starting on the same page, by introducing some fundamental concepts and skills.</p> <p>Training is also helpful for giving students a preview of what they will be experiencing more fully in the later phases of the challenge. Transformative learning requires repeated exposure.</p> <div class="w-100 tc mt4 mv5-ns"><img src="/images/t1k/slides_063.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb1-ns ba b--black-10 pa0 w-100"> <span class="avenir f7 f6-ns tc mb4 db lh-title center caption w-100"><p><em>I am a markdown caption, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thecheesemap/the-cheese-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cheese Map<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></em></p></span></div> <p>What you need to cover in Train depends on the context in which you are teaching, as well as who your students are.</p> <p>For our students, we center our Train phase around 3 fundamental skills.</p> <p><strong>(1) Being an Explorer:</strong></p> <p>To help our students move into an explorer (vs. an achiever) mindset, we structure the Train phase as a series of <strong>challenges</strong> (mini-obstacle courses designed to get students practicing fundamental skills while exploring their interests) and <strong>habits</strong> (tools and practices that help students in the journey ahead).</p> <p><strong>(2) Sending Signals:</strong></p> <p>We define a signal as a way to share intention, gather feedback, and identify allies: like a flare sent out into the world to find others curious about the same topic, or a flag planted in the sand to declare one's stance.</p> <p>Blogposts are very common signals, which make it easier for people to find you and learn what you’re about.

This also allows us to dismantle the damaging and limiting idea of the lone wolf creative genius, and introduce in its place the concept of being a midwife of an idea birthed by the community.</p> <div class="w-100 tc mt4 mv5-ns"><img src="/images/t1k/slides_080.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb1-ns ba b--black-10 pa0 w-100"><img src="/images/t1k/slides_081.png" alt="" class="w-100 mb1-ns ba b--black-10 pa0 w-100"> <span class="avenir f7 f6-ns tc mb4 db lh-title center caption w-100"><p><em>I am a markdown caption, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thecheesemap/the-cheese-map" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cheese Map<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></em></p></span></div> <p>By the time our students are done with the training phase, they have gone through one of the core iterative loops of our class: make something that serves as a signal, have a conversation, and share back what they’ve learned as a new signal.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
