In some ways, it’s straightforward: the students hit the button and their projects go live. It’s the most essential part of the course, because nothing else happens if the project isn’t launched. As instructors, we don’t care about a 100% success rate for the projects, but we do everything in our power to ensure a 100% launch rate each year.</p> <h2 id="launching-on-time"><a href="#launching-on-time" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Launching on time</h2> <p>For the students, launching on time is the biggest challenge because, by this point, they are exhausted and anxious. They are overwhelmed with &quot;what if&quot;s that tempt them to drag their feet and stall however they can:</p> <ul><li>What if no one cares?</li> <li>What if people hate it?</li> <li>What if it’s not ready?</li></ul> <p>We used to underestimate how hard this really is for students, especially those who have never taken a similar leap before. At the moment of launch, it’s too late to address the irrational fears that might derail the process.</p> <p>What we have to do, instead, is to make sure they feel adequately prepared and supported ahead of time. A lot of the process we’ve been describing up until now has been put in place to deal with these anxieties in a systematic way, well before the moment of launch.</p> <p>This was a big realization—it took us a while to realize that we needed a multi-stage rocket to get them into orbit.</p> <p>One final thing we do to ensure everyone launches on time is that we launch together, as a class. Everyone hits the button at the beginning of class and then we celebrate with pie.</p> <p>Once launched, the campaigns run for a full two weeks—we believe that this is sufficient for a well-scoped campaign.</p> <h2 id="getting-anyone-to-care"><a href="#getting-anyone-to-care" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Getting anyone to care</h2> <p>Now comes the second biggest challenge for the students: getting anyone to care. This has gotten <em>much harder</em> in 2019, when everyone's social media feeds are an unrelenting torrent of breaking news and crises.</p> <p>In fact, whether anyone will care is mostly already out of the students' hands by this point. Did they make something people want, or simply something <em>they</em> wanted? Did they talk to the right people? Did they incorporate feedback? Did they find allies and build credibility? Once the project is live, we find out the answers to these questions together.</p> <p>What they <em>can</em> still do, however, is hustle for attention. We prefer to show them how to do outreach rather than marketing: how you make a signal people want to share, how to ask for help, what success looks like. A huge part of it is normalizing the notion that asking for help is necessary, and not shameful. We can’t expect everyone to know what we’re doing and why; outreach is about taking the step to tell people.</p> <div class="w-100 tc mt4 mv5-ns"><img src="/images/t1k/slides_124.png" alt="Screenshots of the hundreds of emails Gary sent out when Orbital was recruiting new members." class="w-100 mb1-ns ba b--black-10 pa0 w-100"><img src="/images/t1k/slides_125.png" alt="Screenshots of the hundreds of emails Gary sent out when Orbital was recruiting new members." class="w-100 mb1-ns ba b--black-10 pa0 w-100"> <span class="avenir f7 f6-ns tc mb4 db lh-title center caption w-100"><p>*At some point, you just need to send out all the emails. *</p></span></div> <p>We help them understand that over the course of the semester, they’ve grown their networks and gained credibility by working in public. They have new relationships, and these are people they need to specifically ask to support them.</p> <p>We’ll also get involved and help signal boost:</p> <ol><li><p><strong>We’ll back each project for $1.</strong>  This helps alert our networks without directly affecting the outcome.</p></li> <li><p><strong>We’ll tweet &amp; retweet throughout the campaign.</strong></p></li></ol> <p>For the most part, the campaigns run like you’d expect. There's a bump of initial interest, followed by a bit of slog (which we refer to as the &quot;valley of despair&quot;), and finally perhaps a bump at the end.</p> <p>For the students, they are fully living in the sea of uncertainty, which can feel terrifying.</p> <div class="w-100 tc mt4 mv5-ns"><img src="/images/t1k/slides_129.png" alt="The ladder of certainty vs. the sea of uncertainty." class="w-100 mb1-ns ba b--black-10 pa0 w-100"> <span class="avenir f7 f6-ns tc mb4 db lh-title center caption w-100"><p><em>Credit: <a href="https://twitter.com/balasubramaniac?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Santhosh Balasubramanian<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></em></p></span></div> <p>Up until now, we were taking them through the training program, but now they're the ones driving.
