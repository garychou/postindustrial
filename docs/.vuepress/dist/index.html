Creators must develop practices for making decisions with incomplete data, recognizing the difference between an obstacle and a dead end, and reflecting on their progress honestly.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The ability to sustain and grow relevant networks:</strong> Networks of people who can provide a creator with advice, support, information, connections, or capital are critical infrastructure. Creators need to be just as intentional about developing this infrastructure as they are about the work itself.</p></li></ul> <p>While some people have more practice with or natural aptitude for these abilities, we know from experience that they can be taught effectively, and that doing so can yield profound results.</p> <p>We see these abilities as fundamental to an emerging and critical form of education, which draws from pedagogies like design and entrepreneurship education.</p> <p>We want to see more classrooms, training programs, and incubators teach these fundamental abilities to the people who need them the most.</p></div></div></div> <div class="w-100 w-50-m w-third-ns fn fl-ns pl4-m f6 black-70 avenir"><span class="bb b--near-white f7 fw5 tracked ttu db mt4 mb4 mb2-ns pl2-ns pb1 black-60">About</span> <div id="awesome" class="measure-ns ml1 ph2 pv3-l ph4-l"><div class="content__about"><p><a href="http://christinaxu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christina Xu<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> has taught Entrepreneurial Design along with Gary Chou at SVA's MFA in Interaction Design program from 2014 through 2018.
