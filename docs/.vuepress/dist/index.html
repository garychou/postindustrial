Blog posts, lectures and case studies will only get you so far. At some point, you need to “do” in order to learn.</p> <p>However, teaching experientially can be both unpredictable and unwieldy, so over the years, their work has coalesced around developing and refining a simple, but powerful tool, the <strong>$1K Challenge:</strong></p> <blockquote><p>“Design, launch and complete a crowdfunding campaign that benefits a community you’ve worked with over the course of the semester.
The campaign should raise at least $1,000 from 50 different backers.”</p></blockquote> <p>Over 100 students have taken the challenge, raising over $300K from thousands of backers <a href="https://youtu.be/e0Jsq6ZsARI?t=610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all out in the real world<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.

Creators must develop practices for making decisions with incomplete data, recognizing the difference between an obstacle and a dead end, and reflecting on their progress honestly.</p> <p>The ability to sustain and grow relevant networks - Networks of people who can provide a creator with advice, support, information, connections, or capital are critical infrastructure. Creators need to be just as intentional about developing this infrastructure as they are about the work itself.</p> <p>While some people have more practice with or natural aptitude for these abilities, we know from experience that they can be taught effectively, and that doing so can yield profound results.</p> <p>We see these abilities as fundamental to an emerging and critical form of education, which draws from pedagogies like design and entrepreneurship education.</p> <p>We want to see more classrooms, training programs, and incubators teach these fundamental abilities to the people who need them the most.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
