And I didn’t even have to take the class. You make the students do what? They have to raise how much money and ship a product? This is madness. Someone needs to stop it! But the students loved it and told me so—at least once it was over.</p> <p>“Entrepreneur” is an overloaded term—almost as bad as “startup.” But this part of entrepreneurship isn’t about how to craft third-quarter projections. Gary and Christina’s class is a lesson in hustle. The clock is ticking, so get your thoughts in order. TICK. Start selling your idea. TOCK. Raise money. TICK. TOCK. Until you’ve got something out in the world, in people’s hands. So maybe you could call this class “Design Hustling for Real.” But no one asks me to name things.</p> <p>Take note of what doesn’t happen here: The students don’t suddenly level up their programming or product management skills to some new, unexpected level. They don’t gain some immense technical understanding. They use the abilities and materials on hand. They don’t ask permission or wait for approval. They collaborate and get moving. I came to understand that this class didn’t give them new skills as much as it gave them a new context—a new way to see themselves as entrepreneurs. Maybe you could call this class “Entrepreneurial Self-image.”</p> <p>This program is the avowed enemy of bureaucracy, which is why it’s powerful. It’s designed to blow up entrenched modes of thought. It puts you on a deadline. And anyone who argues against deadlines argues against everything, good and bad, that makes us human. So maybe you could call it “Entrepreneurship on the Clock.”</p> <p>But none of those names capture the whole of what Gary and Christina have accomplished, so we should just stick with what works. And here we go. You’re lucky. It’s time for your own panic attack—here’s Entrepreneurial Design.</p> <h2 id="the-conversation"><a href="#the-conversation" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> The Conversation</h2> <p>Conversation between <a href="http://christinaxu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christina Xu<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> and <a href="https://garychou.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary Chou<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> on June 20, 2016</p> <p>Edited by <a href="http://bobulate.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liz Danzico<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <h3 id="working-in-public"><a href="#working-in-public" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Working in Public</h3> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> There’s some context we should set up here because it’d be a shame if people thought <a href="http://entrepreneurdesigners.tumblr.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Entrepreneurial Design<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> was purely about teaching people about the operational minutiae of selling a product.</p> <p>There are two broader trends to consider: technology has gotten cheaper and more powerful, and so a single individual can do a lot more than he or she could 20-30 years ago. But also, because we’re all hyperconnected by networks, we’re far more aware of all the narratives happening around us. So there’s this gravitational pull towards realizing your own aspirations, most of which don’t have anything to do with your day job. People aren’t being asked to do more—they want to do more, and they can do so now.</p> <p>But they haven’t been taught how to express and realize their own ideas. For one, industrialized models of education have focused on skill acquisition. Two, this is just a hard and messy thing to teach.</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> A key part of our course is that we ask our graduate students to work in the real world, which is very different from the speculative work that’s more common in traditional design curriculums.

No amount of thinking and speculation can fully prepare you for the real launch process, because unpredictable and indescribable problems are inevitable. How a creator deals with these problems ultimately shapes how good the project can be. If you are prepared to react to those problems and anticipate them ahead of time, that makes you a much more effective creator.</p> <p>Before, if you worked as a designer in a large company, there were other people to take care of figuring out how to mail 150 packages for you. You didn’t have to know that information. But as an independent creator, you can’t just brush that off and say, “this isn’t design; I’m not dealing with it.” The whole process is part of your design.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/a2f2d57bbc4071abc6ee7e1bab05a322_original.b5ef0ca0.gif" alt=""> <em>Class of 2015’s Mikey Chen and Sam Carmichael’s <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sccarmichael/the-upstanding-desk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Upstanding Desk<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></em></p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> But that doesn’t mean you have to actually do everything yourself.</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> Right, and Kickstarter reinforces that—it asks the students to not only define their ideas, but also invite other people to join them.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> And this one of those things that sounds simple, but there are so many underlying things that are complicated and challenging. In order to do what you’re talking about, students need to have some online representation of themselves that they’re comfortable with. And developing and externalizing that identity has been one of the hardest parts about the course.</p> <p>Students have to be willing to put themselves out there—to plant a flag—if they want to benefit from and leverage online networks.

Whether the students hit their $1,000 goal is up to the world, not us. So in the course, we are their coaches and allies working with them, not grading or judging them. That’s quite alien for some of our students.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> I think that’s been one of the most important aspects of the design of the course. It reframes the classroom dynamic, which is traditionally competitive or about seeking approval in some form. And that traditional model is at odds with how how the process of creation works: most people think a course is a single-player game whereas it’s really much more of a multi-player game.</p> <p>The course is intentionally designed to get the students to involve us (and others, including their classmates) in their process and to normalize that collaborative way of working. Instead of thinking that relying on other people is a crutch, we want students to understand that interdependence is core to anyone’s success. In fact, we lean heavily on our own personal and professional networks to be <a href="#acknowledgments">speakers, advisors and supporters</a>.

But networks that are robust stay robust through use—you’re giving the network things it wants, but you’re also asking it for things you want. As long as exchanges are flowing through it, the network stays alive**.**</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> Learning to understand that you have to cultivate this system alongside the creation of your thing is also part of the challenge. Creating the thing is hard enough as it is. Back to the idea of working in the real world, it’d be hard to practice cultivating a network if you were working on a fake project.</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> Also, it really matters that the students are going through this experience together. Having a cohort just makes this process a lot easier because you have a group of people who are not your instructors and not your audience, but working alongside you.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> The value of the cohort is that it expands the surface area of lessons to be learned. You are learning not just from your own experience, but also through observing others in the cohort. You get to learn from the different decisions they've made, the challenges they’ve run into, and how they’ve overcome those. Also, you can calibrate your progress to the others in a way that helps you push forward. It's like having a bunch of running partners.</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> It also helps because when you are thinking about your own project, everything seems hard, muddled, and you have no idea what the next step is. But for whatever reason, it's much easier to see what other people are going through and what their problems are. Giving somebody else the advice they need may actually help unblock you. Effectively, you’re just unlocking parts of your brain by tricking it to work on other people's problems.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/107dc028f85d3e23f36f41227e29d956_original.eb8dffb4.jpg" alt=""> <em>Class of 2016 Datrianna Meeks’ <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1933280852/wwbs-what-would-b-say-playing-cards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Would Beyoncé Say<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> succeeded at getting Beyonce’s attention.</em></p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> Right, everyone is much better at diagnosing everyone else's issues and strengths than diagnosing their own.

In some ways, we all have existing networks, and when they’re useful, we think of the person who helped us rather than the entire system. So, it’s not apparent that you need to be intentional about cultivating it.</p> <p>You recreated the architecture and infrastructure of the course, too, right?</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, so I set up the whole project in four weeks, and then I launched. The project ran for a month, so the whole thing took eight weeks, which was very tight—much tighter than our SVA course, actually.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> And you got yourself a coach?</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> I got myself many coaches! I set up a little board of advisors which was just a loose group of people I would email updates to. I think only half of them ever read the email, but that was fine—it was more about having people who, in my mind, were holding me accountable to progress. On top of that, I had someone I met with once a week who checked in on what I was doing and made sure I wasn’t just spinning my gears.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> Which is great to see.

In a lot of cases, these different roles require completely different and sometimes conflicting priorities and energies. For example, the role of the producer is to make sure something ships on time, and the role of the creative director is to dream up big ideas and point out the things that are not good enough. Those are fundamentally opposing roles. I do know a few people who can do both, but it’s extremely difficult to make that switch in your mind and not end up compromising on both sides.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> Why do you think people try to take it all on themselves?</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> Sometimes, it’s because <em>you</em> don’t even understand what you’re doing yet, so the thought of trying to communicate your intent to other people feels impossible. The myth that you have to know what you are doing every step of the way is something we can help people debunk, but it’s a hard mindset to change. We’ve been taught to believe it is easier just to do it yourself.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> Just that phrase: “Do it yourself.” That’s the problem.</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> It should be: “do it with a bunch of people who have your back.”</p> <h3 id="developing-a-practice-of-momentum"><a href="#developing-a-practice-of-momentum" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Developing a Practice of Momentum</h3> <blockquote><p>I’ve come to really appreciate the process of review as a weapon for getting past the cycle of doubt and uncertainty.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Christina</strong>: There is a related thread here about developing a practice of momentum: how do you maintain weekly progress or make decisions when you’re stuck? How do you work through that cycle of doubt?</p> <p>I’ve come to really appreciate the process of review as a weapon for getting past the cycle of doubt and uncertainty. If you can build in a regular practice of checking in with other people who don’t have a direct stake in what you’re doing, that can be a way forward. It both forces you to make decisions by the time that review happens, but also allows you to get fresh perspective, which is so important when you’re in a solitary creation process. It’s so easy to just fall down a pointless rabbit hole, like <em>how many pages is this thing going to be</em> or <em>what color is it going to be</em>? At some point, you hit decision fatigue as an individual creator. That’s when review can help.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> What are some of the ways we build in review over the course of a semester?</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> First and foremost, we encourage students to blog about what they were doing. In an ideal world, that means their classmates are going to read their posts and leave helpful comments, and maybe even other people from the Internet will read them. At a minimum, it simply makes it more likely that they’ll talk to each other in the studio.</p> <p>Second, rather than having one-on-one time with each student, we organize the students into groups where they critique each other, an idea that our fellow instructor <a href="http://twitter.com/leland" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leland Rechis<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> came up with.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/s_42FD3C04B7B503C990C3619E269FBB0C18BDC250A471A52735CC280C239EE4C5_1485242103307_file.d5bccb6d.png" alt=""></p> <p><img src="/assets/img/s_6EA05FBDED74B3B6624B80BC9CB8928F1569A0C601B1FD4BA3D7A7789458DD99_1483747612831_2016-02-10+20.00.09.d12ab8dc.jpg" alt=""> <em>Students from the Class of 2017 chat with attendees after delivering their public talks</em></p> <p>Third, we have three public-facing milestones—evenly spaced throughout the semester—to help pace their progress:</p> <ul><li>The first milestone (Week 5) is to present their ideas and their questions as a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sva-ixd-entrepreneurial-design-annual-2016-tickets-21103387801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lightning talk<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>—limited to two minutes—to an unknown public audience.</li> <li>The second milestone (Week 7) is to present their nearly finished ideas—in the form of an initial Kickstarter project draft—<a href="http://orbital.nyc/product-sessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to a network of external advisors<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>.

They’re presenting to other people and normalizing this external engagement as part of their process. A regular diet of discomfort is key to maintaining momentum. You have to engineer that into your process. Because, at some point as the students become more comfortable with us, we’re no longer a motivational threat.</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> Neither a threat nor an influence.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> I think the most important change you made was introducing an ideation exercise in the second week of the semester. Historically, we didn’t help the students come up with an idea because we thought that as a bunch of creative people in an MFA program, they could just magically figure that out.</p> <p>However, this is a flawed way to look at it. The ideation phase is a warm safe place—it’s too comfortable. You would stay there forever if you could.</p> <p>And so you need a process to get through it. How did the exercise work?</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> The ideation exercise was about pointing out the things students should be considering as they came up with project ideas.</p> <p>For example, one of the questions we asked that might have been a little bewildering was, “What do you want to do this summer? Do you want to get an internship? Where?”</p> <p>That’s something students are not necessarily used to thinking about as part of their coursework. But for us, it’s very integral to have their project actually be helpful to them because it drives them in a way that nothing else can. It also just gives them a starting place to think about ideas.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/s_6EA05FBDED74B3B6624B80BC9CB8928F1569A0C601B1FD4BA3D7A7789458DD99_1483748001771_2016-01-20+15.56.01.358f0d56.jpg" alt=""> <img src="/assets/img/s_42FD3C04B7B503C990C3619E269FBB0C18BDC250A471A52735CC280C239EE4C5_1485241114009_file.ce7c7848.png" alt=""> <em>Students from the Class of 2017 (above) and the Class of 2018 (below) go through the ideation exercise at the beginning of the semester</em></p> <blockquote><p>…plant a flag and see who shows up.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> The other key aspect was that it wasn’t a solitary exercise. We took them through multiple rounds where they would each look at and riff off each other’s work. I think that made it easier for them to get out of their own heads, and got the students involved in each other’s processes.</p> <p>That’s where the ideas we talked about earlier come into play: it’s not enough to have a practice of momentum.

But in this case, for the students it’s not about the constraints of the $1,000 format; it is about the constraints they discover because they are doing something in real life.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong>  Please elaborate.</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> The $1,000 sounds like a constraint, but it’s actually a goal that comes with constraints. The real constraints are: students have to actually produce the Kickstarter rewards, students have to be able to launch a campaign by the end of the semester, and people have to really give students their money. <em>Those</em> are the constraints they have to design around.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> Right, there’s a difference between designing something that <em>you</em> think is worth $1,000 and something that will actually result in people willingly giving you $1,000. Whether it happens or not is not fully within your control. And that can be scary because students have to have the willingness to be wrong and the willingness to operate under imperfect conditions.</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, I think it’s the art of placing constraints in a way where you’re building an obstacle course that hints towards a set of outcomes. It’s game design, in a way.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> What do you think is the most impactful constraint in the course?</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> I think the most impactful constraint is time. No matter how much people are wiggling, they can’t get out of that one. When you’re three weeks out from launching your project, you have to think about what you can actually get done in three weeks and cut whatever elaborate stop-motion video you were going to shoot for the Kickstarter video—or power through it.</p> <p>Time is also the element that’s missing from most speculative work. Speculative work is unbounded from real resources. You learn to dream up something big without having to think about how you will iterate your way there.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> That seems to make sense to me. The very first year we taught the course, we lacked most of scaffolding that we have today, but what we did have was the constraint of the 15-week semester. Over time, we became more sophisticated and introduced achievable milestones.</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> It was really powerful seeing it in practice—especially in the <a href="http://orbital.nyc/1k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital 1K<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>, where people had to launch in four weeks.

As teachers, we are in the role of showing them different paths forward.</p> <p>But even if you aren’t control-oriented, there’s still a reason you’re teaching this class.

Networks are the infrastructure for resilience—the financial and emotional, but also the creative and intellectual.</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah. For me, if we’re effective at what we are teaching, what we’ll start to plant into students’ heads is not just this literacy of how networks work and how to build and use them, but this greater awareness of all the networks around us.</p> <p>If you push that to an extreme endpoint, what that means is—and this is gonna sound a little corny—that we’re all connected, and that you can’t adopt a zero-sum mindset. If you believe that you are only as successful as your networks, then you become incentivized to help your networks, and your networks’ networks, and so on. Eventually we’re all helping each other and not trying to maintain this very individualistic version of what success looks like. It changes this idea of being an independent creator—which historically has been so dominated by an egocentric and individualistic narrative—into something that’s more about building together.</p> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> Wow, that’s some pretty deep shit.</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah, man.</p> <blockquote><p>It’s clearly insufficient to just care about yourself, so I like the notion of tying your fate to that of the collective.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Gary:</strong> That’s a really elegant way to think about it. I’ve been thinking a lot about this question: “What does it really mean to be a citizen anymore?” There are all sorts of debates about the demise of the nation state and stuff like that but putting all of that aside, what does it mean to care about anything?</p> <p>It’s clearly insufficient to just care about yourself, so I like the notion of tying your fate to that of the collective. As part of the collective, you would make very different design decisions. You would have to understand there are externalities—both positive and negative—to the decisions you make.</p> <p>As designers, we’re not always conscious of the power that we wield or the position we design from.  We’re sometimes so focused on optimizing a certain variable or metric—accomplishing a task that drives shareholder value.  We’re not considering the collective, and you need to do that if you care about spending your time and energy on driving societal value.</p> <p><strong>Christina:</strong> Yeah. That’s a nice way of putting it—all things you need to be aware of as a designer in a post-industrial world.</p> <hr> <p><em>Thanks to the <a href="http://orbital.nyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> members for the design feedback; and to all of our students for the lessons.</em></p> <p><em>For additional resources, syllabi, student reflections and more, visit the course archive: <a href="https://postindustrialdesign.school" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">postindustrialdesign.school<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></em></p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
